   abstract = {Civilians in areas hit by earthquakes become in particular concerned about the safety of family and friends. However, outages in communications networks following these events limit their capacity to get information. So, people drive their cars to check on their loved ones, risking their own lives and hindering the activities of first response organizations. This article proposes LoRaMoto, a communications system that allows civilians to exchange information about their status with others without hampering the first responders and minimizing their exposure to hazards. Furthermore, the information exchanged can be aggregated to support the operations of emergency management. LoRaMoto extends the LoRaWAN architecture and implements a packet-forwarding mechanism between the end nodes of the system. This helps overcome potential infrastructure blackouts after an earthquake, so it provides safety awareness information when it is most needed. We evaluated the system performance and capacity of this system by simulating its use in a realistic environment, testing a baseline configuration, and exploring several modifications to better understand its scalability and its portability to other emergency environments. The simulation results show how the LoRaMoto system can meet the communication needs of civilians, and also keep first response and emergency management organizations informed.},

   abstract = {LoRa is a long-range, low-power, low-bitrate, wireless telecommunications system, promoted as an infrastructure solution for the Internet of Things: end-devices use LoRa across a single wireless hop to communicate to gateway(s), connected to the Internet and which act as transparent bridges and relay messages between these end-devices and a central network server. This paper provides an overview of LoRa and an in-depth analysis of its functional components. The physical and data link layer performance is evaluated by field tests and simulations. Based on the analysis and evaluations, some possible solutions for performance enhancements are proposed.},

@article{Alcott2005,
   abstract = {In The Coal Question William Stanley Jevons [Jevons, W.S., 1865/1965. The Coal Question: an Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of our Coal-mines. 3rd edition 1905, Ed. A.W. Flux. Augustus M. Kelley, New York.] maintained that technological efficiency gains-specifically the more "economical" use of coal in engines doing mechanical work-actually increased the overall consumption of coal, iron, and other resources, rather than "saving" them, as many claimed. Twentieth-century economic growth theory also sees technological change as the main cause of increased production and consumption. In contrast, some ecologically-oriented economists and practically all governments, green political parties and NGOs believe that efficiency gains lower consumption and negative environmental impact. Others doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, holding that efficiency gains 'rebound' or even 'backfire' in pursuing this goal, causing higher production and consumption. Because many environmental problems demand rapid and clear policy recommendations, this issue deserves high priority in ecological economics. If Jevons is right, efficiency policies are counter-productive, and business-as-usual efficiency gains must be compensated for with physical caps like quotas or rationing. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Floyd1994,
   abstract = {The paper considers a network with many apparently-independent periodic processes and discusses one method by which these processes can inadvertently become synchronized. In particular, we study the synchronization of periodic routing messages, and offer guidelines on how to avoid inadvertent synchronization. Using simulations and analysis, we study the process of synchronization and show that the transition from unsynchronized to synchronized traffic is not one of gradual degradation but is instead a very abrupt ‘phase transition’: in general, the addition of a single router will convert a completely unsynchronized traffic stream into a completely synchronized one. We show that synchronization can be avoided by the addition of randomization to the traffic sources and quantify how much randomization is necessary. In addition, we argue that the inadvertent synchronization of periodic processes is likely to become an increasing problem in computer networks. © 1994 IEEE},
