We initially planned to do a performance analysis on the code that we had to develop on the first place but due to unforeseen circumstances the code is not to the final spec, which makes spending time doing a performance analysis a waste of resources as the code still needs some changes that will impact the functionality and the performance


\subsection{General objectives} \label{General objectives}
Because the focus of this research has been put into having a viable product rather than performing the analysis expected in the beginning, the final objectives have changed radically:
\subsubsection{Reliability}
Communications can range between two people sending pictures of cats to highly-critical and time sensitive information. It's important to accommodate all situations and make sure the messages get to the desired destinations.
\subsubsection{User friendliness and low profile}
The communications library should be easy to incorporate to any existing code without much refactoring and it should also be easy to create new programs that use the library without much trouble. In addition, the implementation needs to be easy on the few resources that the devices this code is going to run on have and shouldn't add too much processing overhead.
\subsubsection{Flexibility}
The library should be able to run in different architectures to provide wider compatibility across the ecosystem of IoT

%\subsection{Requirements}

% Functional and non functional requirements. Lo que sigui que aixo vol dir





%Desenvolupar eina de mesura
	% - Convertir el codi del Roger en una llibreria de veritat
	
%Planificar testbeds
%Executar proves
%Analitzar dades pertinents

%Mencionar que els riscs son basicament de temps i no de tecnologia i és que s'està fent analitzant una cosa que funciona
%Mencionar que has comprat una placa de debug (ESP-PROG) per a accelerar el development i que no hi hagi tantes incognites
