The scope of this project overlaps with several laws in the European Union regarding telecommunications and the use of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is important to have the appropriate considerations when dealing with laws and take the necessary measures to stay inside of the constraints these state. According to ETSI, an European standards organization, it is mandatory that no more than 1\% of the time averaging in 1h\cite{DutyCicle} is occupied transmitting and using the electromagnetic space for devices such as the ones we will be using and are in scope of the project.

Even though providing the proper code to make sure this is taken care of would be ideal, doing so while not compromising the objectives of having a user friendly library is more difficult as the only good implementation is one that is completely transparent to the end user, who may be unaware of the regulation or even that this kind of regulation exists. This feature is inside of the list of things to do in the future but currently the library needs the user to take care of this issue. In addition, \cite{DutyCicle} also states allowed transmitting powers and frequencies, however, this is mostly responsibility of the hardware or the end user, as they change slightly depending on the country but the hardware itself is compliant with CE\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking}} so it should never be allowed to operate in disallowed bands or powers.
