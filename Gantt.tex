The following is a representation of the tasks with Gantt graphs, its expected that the work is done on weekdays at 8 h of work a day. The figures don't account for possible holidays for software limitations. In addition the project is expected to be finished before schedule. This is to accommodate probable delays in software development or the experiments. Figures \ref{fig:GanttRLCI}, \ref{fig:GanttSIP} and \ref{fig:GanttTAC} show the schedule defines according to Section \ref{sec:Tasks}
