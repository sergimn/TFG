This is an example of the library logs that will help to better understant how the library behaves. In this testbed there are only two nodes and only one of them is shown. The other one has similar messages but with different origin/destination

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none, caption={Fragment of the initialization logs of the library where it can be seen how the library recieves telemetry from other nodes, builds the routing table and sends some data.}, label=lst:LibraryLog,captionpos=b]
